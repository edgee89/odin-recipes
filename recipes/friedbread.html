    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade fried bread is the perfect accompaniment to eggs or a full English fry-up. 
        It's super-simple to make and needs just two ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral-tasting oil (grapeseed or sunflower work well), or 40g lard</li>
        <li>2 slices thick white bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat half the oil or lard in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry 
            the bread for 1 min 30 seconds until golden, then add the remaining oil or lard, 
            turn the bread over and cook for another 1 min 30 seconds, until golden on both sides.</li>
