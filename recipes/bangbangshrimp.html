    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Shrimp:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound shrimp (large or jumbo, cleaned and deveined)</li>
        <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon sweet chili sauce (I used Frank’s)</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon hot sauce (I used Frank’s hot sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all ingredients for the sauce together and refrigerate until ready for serving.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. 
            To the bowl add the hot sauce, egg, buttermilk and whisk until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp to the bowl, toss to make sure each piece is coated in the batter and set aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl add about a cup of Panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Coat each shrimp with breadcrumbs, add more breadcrumbs as needed.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet. Once the oil is hot, fry the shrimp for 2 minutes on each side till they are 
            a light golden brown. You may need to do this in batches so as to not overcrowd the shrimp. Transfer 
            the cooked shrimp to a plate lined with paper towels and pat any extra oil.</li>
        <li>Drizzle shrimp with sauce and serve.</li>
    </ol>
